# Marmite

## Background - the challenge

A front-end, single page app that uses a self-made testing framework (which we called 'Marmite') and a jQuery-like self-made library (nicknamed 'MQuery' by our group). Everything in this project is written in pure JavaScript, with no pre-made frameworks or libraries used.

## What does it do?

It adds, stores and displays a user's notes inside a single HTML page.

To get an idea of what you'll be building, here are some user stories and a mockup for the notes app. (This is just to give you an idea of the app. You'll work through the challenges below to build it.)

## Instructions

1. Clone and open this directory - `$ git clone git@github.com:BenRoss92/marmite_project.git && cd marmite_project`
2. Run the tests using our self-made MarmiteRunner - `$ open MarmiteRunner.html`
3. Open the single page app for use - `$ open Index.html`
